# Waves and Music

The goal of this assignment is to work with sound, and specifically to think of sound waves as datatypes. We can **represent** sound waves in a computer and perform certain operations on them. You will carry out tasks such as:

- Adding echoes;
- Implementing a high-pass filter to remove low frequency noise from audio;
- Supporting the discrete Fourier transform operation on a sound wave;
- Comparing two sound waves;
- Grouping music by structural similarity.

In addition to implementing the required methods, you will need to develop robust testing strategies for your work and demonstrate code coverage. You should also write method specifications as needed to ensure readability and maintainability of the codebase.
